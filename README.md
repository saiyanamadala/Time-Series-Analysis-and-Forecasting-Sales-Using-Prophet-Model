# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecasting-Sales-Using-Prophet-Model

Project Description:

The Time Series Analysis and Sales Forecasting project involved the comprehensive examination of sales data using the Prophet model. The primary objective was to predict future sales trends and identify key factors influencing sales performance over time.

Key Components:

1. Data Transformation:
   Transformed raw sales data into a structured format suitable for analysis, ensuring data accuracy and consistency. Utilized preprocessing techniques to handle missing values and standardize data formats.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   Conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis to uncover sales trends over the years. Explored correlations between various features and sales performance to identify potential drivers of sales fluctuations.

3. Model Building and Evaluation:
   Built a linear regression model to understand the relationship between independent variables and sales. Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and R-squared to assess predictive accuracy.

4. Forecasting with Prophet Model:
   Utilized the Prophet model, a time-series forecasting tool developed by Facebook, to forecast future sales trends. Leveraged the model's ability to handle seasonality and holiday effects, providing more accurate predictions.

5. Trend Identification:
   Identified and analyzed sales trends over time using the Prophet model. Detected patterns and fluctuations in sales data, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning.

Outcome:

The Time Series Analysis and Sales Forecasting project yielded valuable insights into sales trends and future projections. By leveraging the Prophet model and traditional linear regression techniques, the project provided accurate forecasts and identified key factors influencing sales performance. These insights can inform business strategies, inventory management, and marketing campaigns to optimize sales performance and maximize revenue.
